      "text": "LAS VEGAS\u2014Noting that the dazzling Super Bowl performances had been fun but largely antithetical to the competition, sources confirmed Sunday that yet another field goal had been blocked by Cirque Du Soleil performers doing acrobatics on a goal post. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see so many sparking leotards and death-defying aerial stunts, but they keep knocking the ball straight out of the air whenever a kicker tries to score,\u201d said spectator Carla Jeffries, adding that no matter how many times the referees blew the whistle, the Cirque Du Soleil performers continued to cartwheel, somersault, and backflip across goalposts at each end of the field. \u201cAt first it didn\u2019t seem like a big deal, but then the aerial performers descended from the poles, started riding giant bicycles, walking on stilts, and completely blocking the players from even entering in the end zone. Also, we couldn\u2019t hear anything over the speakers blaring \u2018All You Need Is Love.\u2019 Overall, it was extremely frustrating.\u201d At press time, the crowd began to boo after David Copperfield appeared on the field in a puff of smoke and made the ball disappear every time Patrick Mahomes or Brock Purdy tried to throw it."
