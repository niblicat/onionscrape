      "text": "TOKYO\u2014With the international pop star having rushed onto the private aircraft after a sold-out show at the Tokyo Dome, fans around the world speculated Sunday about whether Taylor Swift would make it to the Super Bowl  after she boarded Buddy Holly\u2019s old plane. \u201cI\u2019m just praying Tay Tay gets to the big game in time to see Travis play despite the low-visibility conditions and the fact that she chartered a 75-year-old plane that\u2019s already been in at least one fatal accident,\u201d said Ohio resident and self-described \u201cSwiftie\u201d Maggie Turnbull, who eagerly refreshed her phone for updates on how far away from Las Vegas the singer was as she traveled in the same Beechcraft 35 Bonanza that crashed on a February night in 1959, killing rock and roll pioneers Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J.P. Richardson, better known as the Big Bopper. \u201cSomeone posted a video from the Tokyo airport, and it was like a fairy tale watching as that rickety old four-seater prop plane disappeared into the snowy fog, taking her across an ocean to see the love of her life.\u201d At press time, fans were reportedly upset after Taylor Swift did not make it to the Super Bowl."
